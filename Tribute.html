    <p id="headline">Ten Greatest Inventions of Nikola Tesla</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>The Tesla Coil</h4>The Tesla Coil is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency electricity. That might fly over the heads of many, so look at it like this – it was a contraption that created flying arcs of electrical energy. His
        coil created huge amounts of energy and allowed him to light bulbs without using wires, among other things. <a id="tribute-link" href="https://nikolateslamuseum.org/en/" target="_blank">The Nikola Tesla Museum</a> in Belgrade demonstrates this
        excellently, allowing the visitor to light a bulb using nothing but their hand and a little bit of Tesla magic. Tesla developed this innovation because he was obsessed with powering cities wirelessly. Today, the Tesla Coil is mostly used for entertainment
        and can be seen in places like science centers and museums, and some elements of it are also used in radios. The importance of the Tesla Coil comes from the fact that it helped engineers understand the nature of electricity and how to use it.</li>
      <li>
        <h4>Bladeless Turbine</h4>In 1913 Tesla received a patent for what he described as his most important invention. That invention was a turbine, known today as the Tesla turbine. This turbine doesn't have any blades, but a series of closely packed parallel
        disks attached to a shaft and arranged within a sealed chamber. When a fluid is allowed to enter the chamber and pass between the disks, the disks turn, which in turn rotates the shaft. This rotary motion can be used in a variety of ways, from
        powering pumps, blowers and compressors to running cars and airplanes. In fact, Tesla claimed that the turbine was the most efficient and the most simply designed rotary engine ever designed.</li>
      <li>
        <h4>Shadowgraphs</h4>In 1894 Tesla began to notice that the photographic plates he used in his laboratory were mysteriously becoming damaged. This started his investigation on what is now known as the x-ray, which at the time was still an unknown
        entity. Tesla invented his own vacuum tube (an x-ray bulb) which emitted electrons from a single electrode, discovering a type of radiation that became known as braking radiation. He produced the first x-ray image using this technique and also
        was the first person to obtain images - the shadowgraphs of the human body. Tesla was the first to point out the clinical benefits of using the x-ray.</li>
      <li>
        <h4>Hydroelectric Power Plant</h4>The Niagara Falls Commission was looking for a company to build a hydroelectric plant that would harness the mighty power of the falls for years. At first, they considered Thomas Edison’s direct current plant, but
        after witnessing Tesla’s alternating current that was offered by Westinghouse Electric, Westinghouse was offered the contract in 1893. Westinghouse used designs from Tesla but a big hurdle remained on the front of getting and keeping funding for
        such an ambitious task that a lot of people doubted would work. Yet when the switch was flipped on November 16, 1896, the Adams Power Plant Transformer House worked and started powering the city of Buffalo, New York. Ten more generators were built,
        and helped power New York City. The plant was considered revolutionary and set the standard for modern hydroelectric power plants.</li>
      <li>
        <h4>Magnifying Transmitter</h4>Tesla became obsessed with transferring power without wires and thought it was possible to do it at higher altitudes, so after securing funding he set up a lab in Colorado Springs in 1899. There, he built the Magnifying
        Transmitter. The Magnifying Transmitter had three coils and was 52 feet in diameter. It generated millions of volts of electricity and shot lightning bolts that were 130 feet long – the biggest man-made lightning at the time. The problem was that
        Tesla was a bit too ambitious for the era, and wireless electricity wouldn’t be developed until the mid-2010s, and as of 2015, it’s still not yet common in households. While this specific project didn’t pan out, the vision and scope are still
        quite impressive. The Magnifying Transmitter was the predecessor to Tesla’s Wardenclyffe Tower, which was supposed to provide free electricity and communications to the world. Tesla started working on the project in 1901, but after financial backers
        pulled out the project fell apart and in 1915 the site went into foreclosure.</li>
      <li>
        <h4>Radio</h4>In 1895, Tesla was getting ready to transmit a radio signal a distance of 50 miles but before he could do that, his lab burned down, delaying the test. Meanwhile in England, an Italian man named Guglielmo Marconi was working on wireless
        telegraphy, and was granted a patent in 1896 for his device. His system was much different than the one Tesla built, using only two circuits but unable to transmit over long distances. Tesla’s invention would use multiple circuits, which would
        make it much stronger. Tesla had two radio patents accepted in the late 19th century, but the financial clout of Marconi’s backers saw the Italian awarded the patent that mattered.</li>
      <li>
        <h4>Neon Lamps</h4>Speaking of things that were once ‘all the rage’, there was a time in the 20th century when you couldn’t walk down a city high street without being bombarded by neon signs of all shapes and sizes. The technology for these monstrosities
        is of course traced back to Nikola Tesla, who developed and used fluorescent bulbs some four decades before they became popularised. Tesla didn’t invent neon lights themselves, but it was his wireless lighting work that led to their creation.
        At the World’s Columbian Exposition, otherwise known as the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, at his personal exhibit Tesla had neon signs that were unique designs and written words. The idea gained popularity and now neon lights and signs light up major
        cities around the world.</li>
      <li>
        <h4>Remote Controle</h4>Tesla was awarded a patent for remote control in 1898, after using a battery-powered boat as a demonstration, an invention he called Teleautomaton. Years passed before the technology was used in any meaningful way, but it is
        difficult to imagine a modern world without remote control tech. Tesla’s invention saw a boat controlled by radio signals, which subsequently powered the rudders and propellers. This invention was a big first in three different areas. The first
        was remote controls, influencing the development of objects like television remotes and garage door openers. Secondly, the boat was also one of the earliest robots, as it was a mechanical object that could be controlled without a human physically
        touching it. Finally, the combination of robotics and radio control technology makes Tesla’s boat the great grandfather of drones. It was another of Nikola’s inventions that went way over the heads of many at the time.</li>
      <li>
        <h4>Induction/Asynchronous motor</h4>An induction motor uses alternating current and essentially has two parts – a stator and a rotor. The stator stays stationary (duh) and uses electromagnets to spin the rotor that’s in the middle. Induction motors
        are noted for being durable, easy to maintain and cheap to run. In the 1880s, there were two people who were working separately on the induction motor: Tesla and Galileo Ferrari. They both presented their findings in 1888, with the Italian inventor
        Ferrari presenting his engine two months before Tesla presented his. However, Tesla’s patents held up under the weight of the evidence. Both had developed the same technology and came to the same independent conclusion, but Tesla had filed his
        patents first. The induction motor was incredibly influential and is still used in everyday products like vacuums, blow dryers, and power tools.</li>
      <li>
        <h4>Alternating Current</h4>Without question, the most important inventions from Nikola Tesla involve his contributions to alternating current (AC). Tesla didn’t exactly invent Alternating Current (AC), but the ‘Electric Jesus’ was the man who made
        AC practical and usable for the entire planet. It wasn’t until wealthy investor George Westinghouse got behind him that Tesla’s work on AC began to be taken seriously, and the AC/DC wars were on. It was a question of practicality in truth. Thomas
        Edison’s Direct Current (DC) needed many power plants to provide electricity to large numbers of people, while Tesla’s AC used thinner wires and was able to transmit over great distances. Edison embarked on a very public smear campaign against
        AC, going so far as using AC to electrocute cats and dogs, but Tesla won out in the end.</li>

  <p id="biography"><strong>Nikola Tesla (July 10, 1856 to January 7, 1943)</strong> was an engineer known for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which is still the predominant electrical system used across the world today. Tesla came to the United
    States in 1884 and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several patent rights, including those to his AC machinery, to George Westinghouse. Throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed ideas for
    a number of important inventions — most of which were officially patented by other inventors — including dynamos (electrical generators similar to batteries) and the induction motor. He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar technology, X-ray
    technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic field — the basis of most AC machinery. Tesla is most well-known for his contributions in AC electricity and for the Tesla coil. He died alone and in poverty. Much more about this exceptional man
